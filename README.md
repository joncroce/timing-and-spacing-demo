# Timing and Spacing Demo

This is an Animotion presentation demonstrating basic easing functions.

Note that animators and developers use conflicting definitions of Easing In/Out.

This demo uses the animators' definition, thus the seemingly inverted easing functions used for Ease In and Ease Out.

See [this article](https://medium.com/@gordonnl/ease-in-or-ease-out-ed9a0969042e) for further clarification.
